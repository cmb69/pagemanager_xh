    Pagemanager_XH simplifies the administration of pages of a CMSimple_XH
    installation. This plugin is comparable to the Menumanager plugin with
    regard to functionality, but by using a treeview it allows for better
    handling of websites with many pages. With Pagemanager_XH it is also
    possible to rearrange whole submenus.

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    This plugin is used exclusively in CMSimple_XH's backend. It is started by
    clicking <em>Pages</em> in the administration menu. Now you see a view of
    your site's structure, that basically resembles the sitemap. However, it is
    possible to open and close page branches in this view, so you don't loose
    overview of even extensive websites. You can open or close those by clicking
    on the small markers left to the page, or by double clicking their titles.
</p>
<img style="max-width:100%; margin:0 auto" src="pagemanager.png" alt="Pagemanager_XH screenshot">
<p>
    Above the tree view of your website's pages you find Pagemanager_XH's
    <strong>toolbar</strong>. The toolbar is particularly useful, if your
    browser doesn't allow Pagemanager_XH's context menu to popup. Note that you
    can disable the toolbar in the plugin's configuration.
</p>
<p>
    Rearrangement of the structure of your pages is done by <strong>drag &amp;
    drop</strong>; when dragging according markers are shown, so you can see
    where the page will be inserted when dropping it. If it is not possible to
    drag to a certain page, because it would result in e.g. a recursive page
    structure, or the resulting nesting level would be too high, this will be
    signalled by a cross or you will simply be not allowed to drop there. <em>So
    carefully watch the markers,</em> until you get a feeling how the drag &amp;
    drop works. If you hold down the CTRL key while dragging, the result will be
    a copy instead of a move operation.
</p>
<p>
    Additional functionality is available in the toolbar or through the
    <strong>context menu</strong> (click the right mouse button on the page).
    You can add new pages, rename or remove existing ones (<em>if you delete the
    selected page, all it's subpages will be deleted as well.</em>), use the
    common clipboard functions as an alternative to drag & drop, and navigate
    directly to a page, either in <em>edit</em> or <em>view</em> mode. Note that
    functionality that is currently unavailable is disabled. For instance, most
    of the functionality requires that a page is selected; if no page is
    selected, these functions are disabled (greyed out). Another example is the
    <em>paste</em> → <em>inside</em> function, which is not available if the
    page in the clipboard should be pasted into itself.
</p>
<p>
    The checkboxes to the left of the pages allow you to view and change their
    <strong>publishing state</strong>. You can configure if they refer to
    'Published?' or 'Show in menu?'. If this setting is empty (what is the
    default), no checkboxes are shown.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Duplicate headings</strong> are marked by a warning icon. It's best
    to fix these right away. <strong>Newly created pages</strong> will be shown
    with a filled folder icon until the next <em>save</em>, to better distinguish
    them from old pages. <strong>Pages that can't be renamed</strong> because
    their headings contain additional markup are marked with a <em>
    tag</em> icon; it is okay to have such pages, but if you want to remove the
    additional markup you have to do this in the editor.
</p>
<p>
    The possiblitly to copy whole substructures might not seem resonable at
    first sight, but it could be useful, e.g. if you've got a gallery on those
    pages, because all content <em>and</em> meta data of these pages will be
    copied too. So it is possible to adjust details afterwards.
</p>
<p>
    Note that there is no undo or cancel functionality. If you've totally mixed
    up your page structure simply refresh your browser's view <em>without</em>
    saving before. Your old page structure will be presented again.

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>

<section>
<h3>Irregular page structures</h3>
<p>
    It is possible that your existing website has an irregular page structure.
    E.g. after an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading immediately follows an
    <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> heading without an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading
    in between. Such irregularities in your page structure might have
    unintentionally been introduced while you were manually editing the page
    structure in the editor (e.g. changing headings, deleting pages), but it is
    possible that this feature is used by your system for a special purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Anyhow, Pagemanager can't handle such irregular page structures, and if it
    detects it, it shows a message and offers you to fix it. If the irregularity
    was introduced accidentially, you may safely confirm and go on. Otherwise
    (or if you're not sure) take a backup of the contents file before you
    proceed, save the fixed structure from Pagemanager, and carefully check, if
    everything still works as expected.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>
    Pagemanager_XH <em>may</em> not work in installations with jQuery dependent
    plugins/addons/templates that don't use jQuery4CMSimple, but import their
    own jQuery library. This won't get fixed (as it's not possible to fix it in
    all cases), because all developers are advised to use only jQuery4CMSimple
    together with all their jQuery based code for CMSimple_XH. So offending
    extensions should be updated!
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Drag &amp; Drop in Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>
    There are known issues regarding drag &amp; drop operations in Internet
    Explorer. Particularly, moving or copying a page inside another page doesn't
    work with the default admin menu. The cause is a <a
    href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3676">limitation in
    jQuery</a>. Either use the "clipboard" functionality, upgrade to Edge (or
    another browser), or use an alternative admin menu.
